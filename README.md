# NetMeerkat

## See if familiar devices are connected to your network with the ping command.

*This project only works on Linux, due to a limitation of `signal` library*

NetMeerkat uses subprocess to run ping commands and detect pre-selected connected devices.

### How to use:
* First fings first, configure familiar devices in `devices.json`, providing their IP address.
* The second step is just run `main.py` file and check the list of devices and their status.
